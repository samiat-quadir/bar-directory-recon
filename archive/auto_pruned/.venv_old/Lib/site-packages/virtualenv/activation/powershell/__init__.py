class PowerShellActivator(ViaTemplateActivator):
    """
    Activates a Python virtual environment in PowerShell.

    This class extends the `ViaTemplateActivator` to provide activation
    functionality specifically for PowerShell. It uses a template file
    (`activate.ps1`) to set up the environment variables and paths required
    to activate the virtual environment in a PowerShell session.

    Usage:
        This class is typically used internally by the `virtualenv` library
        and is not intended to be instantiated directly by end users.
        Instead, users can activate their virtual environment in PowerShell
        by running the `activate.ps1` script located in the `Scripts` folder
        of the virtual environment.

    Important Considerations:
        - Ensure that PowerShell's execution policy allows running scripts.
          You may need to adjust the policy using `Set-ExecutionPolicy`.
        - This activator is designed to work with PowerShell and may not
          function correctly in other shells or environments.
