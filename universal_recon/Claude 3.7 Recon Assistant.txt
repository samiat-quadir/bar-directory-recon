  identifier: Claude 3.7 (Sonnet) – Universal Recon Architecture Support
  role: |
    Core architectural advisor, plugin and utility engineer, and schema compliance lead 
    for the Universal Recon v3.1 project. Focused on making the recon system robust, 
    modular, and future-proof through pluggable components, strict schema validation, 
    snapshot automation, and standard output formatting.

  responsibilities:
    - ✅ Design and implementation of utility modules:
        - snapshot_manager.py (with internal config checks)
        - record_normalizer.py (with strict/soft modes)
    - ✅ Author and maintainer of `email_plugin.py` (plugin-compliant interface)
    - ✅ Plugin compliance validator (ensuring all .apply() plugins adhere to ADA schema)
    - ✅ Schema normalization and field default logic
    - ✅ Assisted in Phase 3 and 4 plugin integration strategy
    - 🧠 Phase 5 co-lead for test harness scaffolding, CLI stubs, and plugin test modeling
    - 🔜 Phase 6: ML plugin prototyping (e.g., ml_labeler.py design)

  major milestones:
    phase_3:
      - Validated core architecture with ADA and Python
      - Proposed modular plugin structure and tagging standards
      - Introduced plugin metadata tagging for discovery and doc purposes
    phase_4:
      - Delivered:
          - email_plugin.py
          - snapshot_manager.py
          - record_normalizer.py
      - Ensured all modules were config-safe and orchestrator-compatible
      - Finalized record schema integration with ADA’s spec
    phase_5:
      - Approved to inject snapshot_manager into orchestrator
      - Staging test harnesses for plugins and utils
      - CLI argument draft underway for `--strict`, `--dry-run`, `--run-plugin`
      - Awaiting orchestrator.py upload to inject snapshot hooks

  confirmed alignments:
    with_python_chat:
      - Plugin `.apply(driver, context)` interface adopted
      - Retry decorators accepted for volatile actions
      - Normalization schema shared across all plugin outputs
      - SnapshotManager is live and integrated
    with_ada:
      - Tagging schema and logging format fully enforced
      - All outputs are passed to record_normalizer(strict=False)
      - CLAUDE plugins are treated as reference for standards
      - Plugin loader and script generation are shared utilities

  pending actions:
    - ⏳ Awaiting orchestrator.py to complete snapshot integration
    - 🔜 Create unit tests:
        - tests/plugins/test_email_plugin.py
        - tests/utils/test_normalizer.py
    - 🛠️ CLI argument stubs in main.py (strict mode, dry-run, plugin runner)
    - 🧪 Begin outlining ml_labeler.py (Phase 6 AI detection)

  status:
    readiness: ✅ Fully integrated with ADA + Python workflows
    schema: ✅ Normalizer and plugin outputs are ADA-compliant
    snapshot_manager: ✅ Confirmed internally config-aware
    record_normalizer: ✅ soft (default) and strict (opt-in) modes available
    CLI support: 🔧 CLI flags planned for Phase 5 finalization
    next_trigger: orchestrator.py injection + test suite launch
