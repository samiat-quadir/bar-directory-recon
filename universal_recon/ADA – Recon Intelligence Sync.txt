## üë§ **Identity & Role**

**ADA (Advanced Data Analysis GPT)** serves as the strategic systems architect and standards coordinator for the `universal_recon` project. I was brought in to support:

- Plugin schema specification  
- Retry, normalization, and output standardization  
- Architecture evaluation to prevent tool bloat  
- Cross-team communication between Claude (Structure/Plugins) and Python (Core Dev)

I also maintain best practices and enforce lean, extensible design across recon modules.

## üìö **Full Chat History Summary**

### üèÅ Initial Context & Motivation
- You (the user) were building a **universal recon tool** to analyze and extract structured data (emails, names, etc.) from **lawyer directories**.
- The early script, while functional, lacked generalization, schema normalization, and graceful recovery.
- You requested help **analyzing, enhancing, and future-proofing** the tool without recreating the over-engineered complexity of a previous abandoned system.

---

### üîÑ Early Comparison & Audit
- ADA analyzed your working script and compared it to:
  - A conceptual ‚Äúv2‚Äù with modular improvements (e.g., iframe support, obfuscation parsing)
  - A fully modularized ‚Äúv3‚Äù example response provided in YAML (with orchestrator, retry, snapshotting)
- You also uploaded parts of your older complex system (`auto_schemer.py`, `data_extractor.py`, etc.) for audit, which ADA reviewed to avoid repeating mistakes (excessive abstraction, coupled logic).

### üß± Evolution Toward `universal_recon v3.1`
With input from ADA, Python, and Claude, the team aligned on a **modular folder-based architecture**:

```text
universal_recon/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ orchestrator.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ driver_manager.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugin_loader.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugins/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ form_autofill.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ email_plugin.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ detection/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ email.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ phone.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ name.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ retry.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ record_normalizer.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ snapshot_manager.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logger.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ configs/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ defaults.json
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utah_bar.json
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rhode_island_bar.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ output/, screenshots/, snapshots/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py
```

Each module:
- Has a **single responsibility**
- Is **config-driven**
- **Fails gracefully**
- **Logs namespaced outputs**
- Produces **standardized JSON records**

### ‚úÖ Major Features Locked
1. **Standard Record Schema (ADA)**  
   Each `record` must have:  
   `type`, `value`, `xpath`, `context`, `url`  
   Optional: `confidence`, `source`, `category`  
   Enforced via `record_normalizer.py`

2. **Retry Decorators (ADA)**  
   Used on volatile operations only (fetch, click, AJAX)

3. **Plugin Interface (All)**  
   Must expose:
   ```python
   def apply(driver, context: str) -> list[record]
   ```

4. **Plugin Loader (ADA)**  
   Dynamically loads config-enabled plugins
   Handles errors, returns unified records

5. **Snapshot Manager (Claude)**  
   Saves screenshots and HTML
   Internally checks config
   Format:
   ```python
   save_screenshot(driver, "label", config=config, logger=logger)
   ```

6. **Email Plugin (Claude)**  
   Wraps `detection/email.py` with `.apply()`
   Logs, returns normalized records

7. **Orchestrator (Python)**  
   Coordinates all stages:
   - Fetch
   - Form autofill (plugin)
   - Pagination
   - Plugin execution
   - Normalization
   - Output saving

### üîÅ Phase 5 Launch ‚Äì Team Goals

| ADA | Python | Claude |
|-----|--------|--------|
| `record_field_validator.py` | CLI & test suite wiring | Inject snapshot calls |
| `DEV_GUIDE.md` | Normalize plugin output | Create test scaffolds |
| `microdata_parser.py` plugin | CLI: `--strict`, `--dry-run`, etc. | Begin `ml_labeler.py` |
| Support test harnesses | Orchestrator enhancements | Save & finalize Phase 5 files |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Hold Status
Claude encountered a block injecting `save_screenshot()` into `orchestrator.py` due to the file not being uploaded to their canvas. They need the **latest `orchestrator.py`** to proceed with:

- Pre-core, post-core, and post-plugin snapshot injection
- Logging snapshot results

Once uploaded, Claude will:
- Patch the file with snapshot hooks
- Proceed to `test_email_plugin.py` + `test_normalizer.py`

---

## üîÑ ADA‚Äôs Current Status
- Standing by for Claude's injection to complete
- Will follow with:
  - Validator helper
  - DEV_GUIDE
  - Plugin scaffold support
- Monitoring strict-mode adoption + output validation pipeline

‚úÖ **Project Phase**:  
üü¢ **Phase 5 ‚Äì Execution, Testing, Snapshot Integration**  
Next: Snapshot injection ‚Üí Test harnesses ‚Üí CLI enhancements ‚Üí Final Phase 5 sync

Let me know when you‚Äôve uploaded `orchestrator.py`, and ADA will support the next coordination cycle.
