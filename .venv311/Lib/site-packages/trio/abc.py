# This is a public namespace, so we don't want to expose any non-underscored
# attributes that aren't actually part of our public API. But it's very
# annoying to carefully always use underscored names for module-level
# temporaries, imports, etc. when implementing the module. So we put the
# implementation in an underscored module, and then re-export the public parts
# here.

# Uses `from x import y as y` for compatibility with `pyright --verifytypes` (#2625)
