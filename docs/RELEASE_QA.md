# Release QA â€” v0.1.0 (Retrospective)

## Context

Version **v0.1.0** was released **before** the `cli-pack` workflow was introduced (PR #295, merged Oct 27).
Therefore, no workflow artifacts exist for comparison.

## Retrospective Build

A local build from the v0.1.0 source was performed to document baseline hashes:

| Artifact | SHA256 (local build from tag) |
|---|---|
| bar_directory_recon-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl | 0b44cbf1409789bc6d3a503dc31dfc26b1869237b462d76b87d04cc5dc26795e |
| bar_directory_recon-0.1.0.tar.gz | 8ae125348ff84a5e0d786a689932e551d72ad767e28d0657415f2093b18d6133 |

## Release Assets Status

No assets were attached to the v0.1.0 release.

## Recommendations

1. **Future Releases**: Use `cli-pack` workflow (manual dispatch or release trigger) to build and attach wheel/sdist
2. **Current State**: cli-pack.yml is available on `main` with `workflow_dispatch` trigger
3. **Next Release**: Follow `docs/release-playbook.md` for complete pack sanity verification

## Notes

- This is a **retrospective analysis** since cli-pack didn't exist at v0.1.0 release time
- Future releases (v0.1.1+) will have full workflow artifact vs release asset parity checks
- See `scripts/2025-10-28-pack-sanity-v010.ps1` for the standard pack sanity procedure (requires cli-pack workflow)
