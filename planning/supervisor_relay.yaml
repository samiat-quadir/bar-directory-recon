phase_28_gitmo_signal:
  date: 2025-05-07
  from: Supervisor Assistant
  to: GitMo
  subject: Phase 28 QA Oversight – Execution Tracker Integration

  summary:
    context: >
      Supervisor has reviewed Claude’s `README_phase_28.md` and compared it to the
      YAML execution tracker used for Phase 28 orchestration. The README is strong
      for documentation but does not capture internal execution state or progress.
    decision: >
      Maintain both: use `README_phase_28.md` for public CI/docs, and
      `planning/phase_28_execution_tracker.yaml` for real-time task coordination and reporting.

  new_scripts_added:
    - path: tools/generate_phase_report.py
      purpose: "Creates readable daily report from execution tracker YAML"
    - path: tools/phase_execution_checker.py
      purpose: "Validates expected outputs, CI workflows, and test coverage"

  optional_recommendations:
    scoped_update_scripts:
      description: >
        Create per-assistant YAML updater scripts (e.g. update_tracker_python.py) to mark their
        tasks as complete in `phase_28_execution_tracker.yaml` safely.
      benefit: "Prevents role collision, enables modular assistant updates"

    copilot_integration:
      prompt_example: >
        "Copilot Agent: Mark 2nd task as complete for ADA in phase_28_execution_tracker.yaml"
      benefit: "Non-scripted assistants (like Claude) can update tracker via prompt relay"

    automation_trigger:
      option: "Add generate_phase_report.py to GitHub Actions or Task Scheduler (daily summary)"
      output: "Export to /logs/phase_28/report_<date>.md"

  implementation_request:
    - Assign GitMo responsibility to own and validate `planning/phase_28_execution_tracker.yaml`
    - Confirm write-access model:
        - [ ] Can GitMo directly patch assistant checkboxes?
        - [ ] Or should each assistant receive scoped patch scripts?
    - Optionally generate:
        - [ ] update_tracker_python.py
        - [ ] update_tracker_ada.py
        - [ ] update_tracker_claude.py
    - Update `.gitignore` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml` if required

  next_actions:
    - Confirm tracker as live operational file with GitMo
    - Embed tracker status into GitMo-to-Director relay
    - Once approved, assign update script scaffold per assistant

  notes_to_gitmo:
    - I (Supervisor) will remain passive unless QA anomalies or inefficiencies arise
    - Let me know if any update format, validation policy, or CI integration needs design help
