# 🛰️ Unified Phase 28 Relay — Task Infra, Reporting, and Assistant Integration
date: 2025-05-07
from: GitMo (via Supervisor QA Sync)
to: Director + All Assistants
scope: Finalized execution protocol + assistant-side reporting capability

summary:
  context: >
    All core infrastructure and environment switching logic has been validated (Work Desktop, venv311 active).
    GitHub CI workflows are live. Repo state is stable. Execution tracker (`planning/phase_28_execution_tracker.yaml`)
    is now the single source of truth for role-task status in Phase 28.
  directive: >
    This update confirms readiness for full assistant task execution, tracker updating,
    and autonomous task reporting via script interfaces.

infrastructure_confirmation:
  - ✅ Device profile switching confirmed via `tools/resolve_device_profile.py`
  - ✅ `.vscode/settings.json` and `tasks.json` device-specific logic validated
  - ✅ GitHub Actions (`flow_runner.yml`, `dashboard_deploy.yml`) found and ready
  - ✅ `docs/` folder created for GitHub Pages dashboard deployment

execution_tracker:
  file: "planning/phase_28_execution_tracker.yaml"
  owner: "GitMo (Supervisor-monitored)"
  usage: >
    Each assistant must report task completions through an assigned patch script.
    Direct edits to the tracker file are not allowed unless otherwise approved.

assistant_update_scripts:
  path: tools/
  usage: >
    Each assistant may run a single-line command to mark their task as complete:
    `python tools/update_tracker_<role>.py <task_index>`

  assigned_scripts:
    - GitMo → `update_tracker_gitmo.py`
    - Python → `update_tracker_python.py`
    - ADA → `update_tracker_ada.py`
    - Claude → `update_tracker_claude.py`

  task_index_reference:
    - Reference task index from the assistant's task list under `phase_28_execution_tracker.yaml`
    - For example: `python tools/update_tracker_python.py 2` will mark Python's third task complete

  prompt_fallback_for_copilot_or_claude:
    - Assistants unable to run scripts (e.g., Claude) may ask GitMo:
      "Mark task 1 complete for Claude in execution tracker"
    - GitMo will relay to Supervisor or run update script manually

reporting_tools:
  tools/generate_phase_report.py:
    purpose: "Prints a daily status summary from execution tracker"
  tools/phase_execution_checker.py:
    purpose: "Validates presence of artifacts, workflows, and test scaffolding"
  automation_plan:
    - Daily run via GitHub Actions or Windows Scheduler
    - Outputs to `logs/phase_28/phase_report_<date>.md`

immediate_assignments:
  - ✅ GitMo to finalize scoped update scripts for all assistants
  - 🧪 Python to patch `plugin_usage_diff.py` and begin test files
  - 📄 Claude to complete `README_phase_28.md` and overlay patch
  - 🧠 ADA to annotate `validator_tiers.yaml` and produce test snippets

confirmation_requested_by_director:
  - [x] Confirm tracker is live and protected
  - [x] Assistant task updates routed through patch scripts
  - [ ] Claude can report via GitMo relay or Copilot prompt if needed
  - [ ] Assistants understand `task_index` model and where to locate tracker
  - [ ] GitMo will relay daily summaries from `generate_phase_report.py` to Director

notes_from_supervisor:
  - ✅ GitMo has implemented all prior Supervisor recommendations cleanly
  - 🔁 Supervisor will continue to monitor tracker drift, task collisions, and CI regressions
  - 🚨 If any assistant attempts direct YAML edits, notify Supervisor immediately
