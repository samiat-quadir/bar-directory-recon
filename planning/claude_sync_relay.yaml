Based on the latest `director_phase28_sync.yaml` relay and the current state of our work, here’s a complete response that addresses both your immediate question (“What should I do next?”) and the next steps I (Claude) will now undertake:

---

### ✅ Summary of Current Phase 28 Progress

* **Phase 27 is finalized**, including test/lint integration, docstrings, and hotfix restoration.
* **Phase 28 is underway**, focused on environment syncing, CI/CD workflow, overlay enhancements, Motion API migration, and test expansion.
* Claude's tasks from Phase 27 (badge rendering, HTML overlays, risk emitter) are complete and verified.
* You have aligned the workstream across assistants and ensured cross-device parity (Work Desktop + ASUS).

---

### 📌 Claude's Immediate Responsibilities (based on `director_phase28_sync.yaml`)

#### 1. Finalize `README_phase_27.md`

* ✅ Status: Nearly complete.
* 🔄 Action: I will drop the **final copy** with:

  * CI testing strategy (Docker + local)
  * pytest usage notes
  * docstring lint logic
  * overlay validation summary

#### 2. Bootstrap `README_phase_28.md`

* 🎯 Goal: Scope out dashboard deployment, Motion API work, `.env` sync, and CI-driven HTML preview logic.
* 🟢 I will provide the scaffolded draft right after the README for 27.

#### 3. Integrate `risk_overlay.json` hook into `drift_dashboard_generator.py`

* 🔗 Status: HTML already shows badges from `validator_tiers.yaml`.
* 🔄 Update: I’ll inject `risk_overlay.json` consumption to:

  * show **tier badge**, **reason**, and **risk level** per site.
  * include tooltips from `suppression_reason` when ADA finishes the YAML patch.

#### 4. Write pytest for `drift_dashboard_generator.py`

* 🧪 Status: Pending, delegated from Python after overlay integration is complete.
* ✅ I will drop this test file in `universal_recon/tests/test_drift_dashboard_generator.py`.

### 🧭 What *You* Should Do Next (Director Guidance)

Here’s what I recommend you focus on now:

#### 🔄 Merge Tracking + Environment Sanity

1. **Review the open PRs from Copilot**:

   * `sync_env.py`
   * `motion_task_via_api.py`
   * GitHub Action workflows (`flow_runner.yml`, `dashboard_deploy.yml`)

2. **Commit and verify `.env.template`**

   * Cross-check that its keys match both `.env.work` and `.env.asus`
   * I can help you generate a validator for these if needed.

3. **Coordinate with Python on `plugin_usage_diff.py`**

   * It needs to be parameterized with `--before` and `--after`
   * Once patched, I can use it to enrich the risk dashboard.

4. **Ping ADA about `suppression_reason`**

   * Confirm the YAML format (she’s expected to finalize that soon)
   * Once it lands, I’ll propagate it to `risk_overlay.json` and the HTML overlays.

### 📤 Immediate Drops From Claude

I will now generate and post the following, in separate markdowns for easy saving:

1. `README_phase_27.md` (final)
2. `README_phase_28.md` (scaffold + assignments)
3. `test_drift_dashboard_generator.py`
4. `drift_dashboard_generator.py` update with `risk_overlay.json` integration (if not already patched)

Would you like me to include `risk_overlay.schema.json` for future CI schema validation as well?

Let me know if you want a YAML schema validator for suppression or overlays. Otherwise, I’ll begin the drops now.
