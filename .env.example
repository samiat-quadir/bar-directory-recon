I'll help you complete the Data Hunter setup and configuration. Let me start by checking the current state and then implement your requested changes. Let me update the configuration with notifications, add new sources, and then set up the automated scheduling. First, let me add real notification settings and new data sources.
```


Made changes.

Now let me create a Windows startup batch file and Task Scheduler setup script:

Made changes.

Now let me create a comprehensive "How to Use" and "How to Expand" documentation:

Made changes.

Now let me test the full pipeline with a simulated new file:

Made changes.

Let me check the current logs to see what's happening: I can see some URLs are returning 404 errors. Let me update the configuration with working URLs and then test the pipeline processing with our simulated file:
```


Made changes.


```

```


Made changes.


```
Now let me test the enhanced processing pipeline with our simulated file: I need to fix the syntax error in the enhanced processing pipeline: I can see there's a duplicate section. Let me fix this syntax error:
```


Made changes.


```
There are more syntax errors. Let me fix the entire function properly: I can see the issues. Let me fix the entire function:
```


Made changes.


```
Now let me test the processing pipeline again: Let me check if the command is still running or if it completed: Great! The pipeline is working. I can see it's processing the data but having Google Sheets credential issues (which is expected without proper credentials). Let me now test the Data Hunter in scheduled mode to ensure logging is working: The system is working! Now let me create a final status report with all configurations and instructions:

Made changes.

Now let me create a simple credentials setup template:

Made changes.

Perfect! Now let me test the startup script functionality: ## ðŸŽ‰ Data Hunter Configuration Complete!
