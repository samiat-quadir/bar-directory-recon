```bash
# Run the setup wizard
RunListDiscovery.bat setup

# Or manually install dependencies
pip install -r list_discovery/requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure URLs
```bash
# Add a URL to monitor
RunListDiscovery.bat add "https://county.gov/licenses" "County Licenses"

# Edit config file directly
notepad list_discovery/config.yaml
```

### 3. Run Discovery

RunListDiscovery.bat check

# Continuous monitoring
RunListDiscovery.bat monitor
```

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration (`list_discovery/config.yaml`)

```yaml
# URLs to monitor
monitored_urls:
  - url: https://example-county.gov/licenses
    name: "Example County Liquor Licenses"

# Download settings
download_dir: "input/discovered_lists"
file_extensions: [".pdf", ".csv", ".xls", ".xlsx"]
check_interval: 3600  # 1 hour

# Notifications
notifications:
  discord_webhook: "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."
  email:
    enabled: true
    smtp_server: "smtp.gmail.com"
    username: "your-email@gmail.com"
    recipients: ["admin@company.com"]
```

### Advanced Settings

```yaml
advanced:
  user_agent: "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)"
  request_timeout: 60
  request_delay: 2
  max_file_size: 100  # MB
```

## Usage Examples

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Interactive menu
RunListDiscovery.bat

# Direct commands
RunListDiscovery.bat check
RunListDiscovery.bat status
RunListDiscovery.bat add "https://city.gov/permits"
RunListDiscovery.bat remove 1
```

### Python API

```python
from list_discovery.agent import ListDiscoveryAgent

# Initialize agent
agent = ListDiscoveryAgent()

# Run single check
files = await agent.run_single_check()

# Add URL programmatically
agent.add_url("https://county.gov/licenses", "County Licenses")

# Get statistics
stats = agent.monitor.get_statistics()
```

### Integration with Universal Runner

The List Discovery Agent integrates seamlessly with the Universal Project Runner:

```python
# In automation/universal_runner.py
from list_discovery.agent import ListDiscoveryAgent

async def run_list_discovery():
    agent = ListDiscoveryAgent()
    new_files = await agent.run_single_check()
    
    if new_files:
        # Trigger main pipeline processing
        await run_main_pipeline()
```

## File Organization

```
list_discovery/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agent.py              # Main discovery agent
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.yaml           # Configuration file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ state.json            # Monitoring state (auto-generated)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md             # This documentation

input/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ discovered_lists/     # Downloaded files
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ county_licenses_20240101_120000.pdf
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ city_permits_20240101_120030.csv
```

## State Management

The agent maintains persistent state in `list_discovery/state.json`:

```json
{
  "last_check": "2024-01-01T12:00:00",
  "discovered_files": {
    "https://county.gov/licenses": [
      "https://county.gov/files/licenses_2024.pdf"
    ]
  },
  "page_hashes": {
    "https://county.gov/licenses": "abc123..."
  },
  "download_history": [
    {
      "url": "https://county.gov/files/licenses_2024.pdf",
      "filename": "licenses_2024.pdf",
      "source_page": "https://county.gov/licenses",
      "downloaded_path": "input/discovered_lists/licenses_2024_20240101_120000.pdf",
      "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Monitoring and Logging

### Log Files
- `logs/automation/list_discovery.log` - Detailed operation logs
- Includes discovery events, download status, and errors
- Integrated with main automation logging system

### Status Dashboard
The List Discovery Agent status is included in the main automation dashboard:
- Files discovered today/week/month
- Active monitoring URLs
- Recent download activity
- Error reports and alerts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**
   ```bash
   pip install aiohttp aiofiles beautifulsoup4 PyYAML
   ```

2. **Permission Denied**
   - Check download directory permissions
   - Ensure write access to `input/discovered_lists/`

3. **Website Blocking Requests**
   - Adjust `user_agent` in configuration
   - Increase `request_delay` to be more respectful
   - Some sites may require additional headers

4. **Files Not Downloading**
   - Check file extension filters
   - Verify URL accessibility
   - Review logs for specific error messages

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging:

```bash
# Set environment variable
set LOGLEVEL=DEBUG
python list_discovery/agent.py check
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Respectful Monitoring
- Use reasonable check intervals (1+ hours)
- Include delays between requests
- Use appropriate user agents
- Respect robots.txt files

### 2. Configuration Management
- Regularly backup configuration files
- Document URL sources and purposes
- Monitor for broken/moved URLs

### 3. File Management
- Regular cleanup of old downloaded files
- Monitor disk space usage
- Organize files by date/source

### 4. Error Handling
- Monitor logs for recurring errors
- Set up alerts for failed downloads
- Have fallback plans for critical sources

## Integration Points

### With Universal Project Runner
- Discovered files trigger main pipeline
- Shared notification system
- Common configuration management
- Unified logging and monitoring

### With External Systems
- Discord/Slack notifications
- Email alerts and reports
- Database logging for analytics
- API endpoints for external triggers

## Security Considerations

1. **Configuration Security**
   - Store sensitive data (API keys, passwords) securely
   - Use environment variables for credentials
   - Restrict file permissions on config files

2. **Download Safety**
   - Validate file types and sizes
   - Scan downloaded files for malware
   - Quarantine suspicious downloads

3. **Network Security**
   - Use HTTPS when available
   - Validate SSL certificates
   - Consider VPN/proxy for sensitive sources

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- JavaScript rendering for dynamic pages
- Content analysis and filtering
- Duplicate detection across sources
- Advanced scheduling options
- REST API interface

### Advanced Monitoring
- Content change alerts (not just new files)
- Structured data extraction
- Pattern recognition for new data types
- Machine learning for source discovery

## Support and Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Update URL configurations
- Review and clean logs
- Monitor disk space usage
- Test notification systems

### Updates and Patches
- Check for dependency updates
- Review security advisories
- Update user agents as needed
- Monitor source website changes

## Performance Metrics

The List Discovery Agent tracks:
- URLs monitored
- Files discovered per day/week/month
- Download success rates
- Response times and errors
- Storage usage and cleanup needs

These metrics are available through the status command and integrated into the main automation dashboard.
