# Git Pre-commit Permission Fix - August 18, 2025

## Issue Summary
Pre-commit hooks were failing with Windows permission errors:
```
PermissionError: [WinError 5] Access is denied: 'C:\\Users\\samqu\\.cache\\pre-commit\\repo9_rbfrwq\\py_env-python3'
```

## Root Cause
- Corrupted pre-commit cache with locked Python virtual environment directories
- Windows permission inheritance issues in the cache folder
- Stale file locks from previous pre-commit processes

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Cache Directory Cleanup
- Used `takeown` and `icacls` to fix permissions
- Removed corrupted cache directory at `C:\Users\samqu\.cache\pre-commit`
- Created `fix_precommit.ps1` script for automated resolution

### 2. Verification
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks now installing successfully
- ✅ All hooks passing: trim whitespace, fix end of files, detect-secrets
- ✅ Git commits working normally without `--no-verify`

### 3. Prevention
- Created PowerShell script for future permission issues
- Documented workaround using `--no-verify` for emergency commits
- Added recommendations for periodic cache cleanup

## Status: RESOLVED ✅

Pre-commit hooks are fully operational. The fix script `fix_precommit.ps1` is available for future issues.

## Next Steps
- Monitor for recurring permission issues
- Consider running `pre-commit clean` periodically
- Use the fix script if similar problems occur
