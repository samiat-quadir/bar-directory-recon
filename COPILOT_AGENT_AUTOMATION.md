# Copilot Agent Automation Guide

## Overview

This document explains how Copilot Agent has been configured to be more automated and require less user input when running commands in the terminal.

## Automated Features

### 1. VS Code Settings

The following settings have been added to `.vscode/settings.json`:

- `github-copilot.agent.terminalExecutionMode`: "automatic" - Allows Copilot Agent to run terminal commands without prompting
- `github.copilot.advanced.terminalAccess`: true - Enables Copilot Agent to access the terminal
- `github.copilot.chat.agent.onFileOpen`: "always" - Makes Copilot Agent available when files are opened
- `github.copilot.chat.agent.terminalIntegration`: "terminalIntegrationOn" - Enables terminal integration
- `github.copilot.chat.autoRunning`: "On" - Enables auto-running of commands
- `github.copilot.chat.incrementalTaskReattempts`: 2 - Allows Copilot to reattempt tasks
- `github.copilot.chat.agent.terminalAuthorization`: "always" - Authorizes terminal usage

### 2. Helper Scripts

- **CrossDeviceLauncher.bat**: Automated script for setting up the environment
  - Automatically fixes Git repository issues when possible
  - Creates device profile if missing
  - Runs cross-device path tests
  - Validates the Python environment

- **CopilotAgentHelper.psm1**: PowerShell module with automated task functions
  - Available as `Invoke-CopilotTask` command with various task options
  - Logs all activities in `logs/copilot_agent_automation.log`

### 3. Shortcut Commands

The following command aliases are available in the terminal:

- `fixgit`: Attempt to fix Git repository issues
- `validate`: Validate Python environment
- `scanpaths`: Scan for hardcoded paths
- `fixpaths`: Scan and fix hardcoded paths
- `crosstest`: Run cross-device path tests

## How It Works

When VS Code starts:

1. The startup script (`startup.ps1`) loads automatically
2. It detects your device and sets up logging
3. It loads the Copilot Agent helper profile
4. It automatically activates the virtual environment
5. The helper functions are made available as shortcuts

## Recommended Usage

When using Copilot Agent for automation:

1. **For simple commands**: Just ask Copilot to run them directly - it will run without prompting

2. **For complex workflows**: Ask Copilot to use the shortcuts

   ```bash
   Please run the fixgit command to repair my Git repository
   ```bash

3. **For custom tasks**: Ask Copilot to use the Invoke-CopilotTask function

   ```
   Please run Invoke-CopilotTask -Task fixpaths to scan for hardcoded paths and fix them
   ```

## Limitations

- Some Git operations might still require manual intervention if they involve authentication
- Very complex operations might need to be broken down into smaller tasks
- Copilot Agent might still ask for permission for operations that could potentially be destructive

## Troubleshooting

If Copilot Agent is still asking for confirmation:

1. Reload VS Code window
2. Check that all the settings in `.vscode/settings.json` are correct
3. Run the command manually first, then have Copilot Agent automate it next time
