- **Experience Scoring**: Calculated scoring based on years of experience and case history
- **Standardized Output**: Consistent data format for integration with the reconnaissance framework

## Technical Implementation

### Plugin Architecture
```
universal_recon/plugins/collab_divorce.py
├── CollabDivorcePlugin class
├── Data fetching (mock implementation)
├── Data transformation pipeline
├── Validation engine
└── Utility methods for data normalization
```

### Test Coverage
```
universal_recon/tests/plugins/collab_divorce/
├── __init__.py
└── test_offline.py (comprehensive offline test suite)
```

## Data Schema

### Input Data Format
The plugin processes attorney records containing:
- Name and credentials
- Practice areas and certifications
- Contact information (phone, email)
- Geographic location
- Experience metrics (years, case count)

### Output Data Format
Standardized attorney records include:
```json
{
  "name": "string",
  "email": "string", 
  "phone": "string",
  "city": "string",
  "state": "string",
  "practice_areas": ["array"],
  "certifications": ["array"],
  "years_experience": "number",
  "collaborative_cases": "number",
  "experience_score": "number",
  "firm_domain": "string",
  "source_url": "string",
  "plugin_name": "collab_divorce",
  "record_type": "collaborative_attorney"
}
```

## Validation Results

### Test Coverage Summary
- ✅ **Plugin Registration**: Factory function and name validation
- ✅ **Data Fetching**: Mock data generation for offline testing
- ✅ **Data Transformation**: Comprehensive field mapping and normalization
- ✅ **Validation Engine**: Email, phone, and location validation
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of malformed input data
- ✅ **Pipeline Integration**: End-to-end processing workflow

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Count**: 25+ individual test cases
- **Coverage Areas**: All major plugin methods and utilities
- **Validation Rules**: 5+ validation criteria for data quality

## Offline Testing Strategy

The plugin is designed for development and testing in offline environments:

1. **Mock Data Generation**: Realistic attorney profiles for testing
2. **Deterministic Output**: Consistent results across test runs  
3. **No External Dependencies**: No network calls during testing
4. **Comprehensive Validation**: All transformation logic tested offline

## Integration Notes

### Plugin Registry
The plugin integrates with the universal reconnaissance framework through:
- Standard Plugin protocol implementation
- Factory function for instantiation
- Consistent naming convention (`collab_divorce`)

### Future Enhancements
- Live scraping implementation for production use
- Enhanced geographic coverage
- Additional certification tracking
- Integration with state bar APIs

## Compliance and Security

### Data Handling
- No sensitive data storage in source code
- Validation-first approach to data processing
- Standardized output format for consistent handling

### Testing Philosophy
- Offline-first development approach
- Mock data prevents unintended external calls
- Comprehensive validation prevents data corruption

## Conclusion

The collaborative divorce plugin provides a solid foundation for processing attorney data from collaborative law directories. The offline testing capability ensures reliable development and validation workflows while maintaining production readiness for future live implementation.
