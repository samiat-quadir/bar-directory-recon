- Ensured all imports are present and robust (loguru fallback to logging).
- Added/modernized health check for config and log folder existence.
- Ensured all config and log folders/files are auto-created if missing.
- Refactored HTML dashboard generation for Python 3.11 compatibility (no f-string backslashes, long lines split).
- Used a variable for the success rate class to avoid long f-string expressions.
- All logic and docstrings reviewed for clarity and maintainability.
- All mypy and VS Code critical errors resolved for this module.
- Ready for advanced automation and monitoring.

---

[automation/universal_runner.py]
-------------------------------
- Added type hints to all major classes, methods, and variables for clarity and static analysis.
- Improved logging and error handling throughout the runner and monitoring logic.
- Added health/config folder auto-creation in the runner constructor.
- Fixed config access in InputMonitor to use correct dictionary keys.
- Documented all major classes and methods with docstrings.
- Ensured all batch triggers, notification, and dashboard update logic is robust and maintainable.
- Fixed Python 3.11 compatibility issues and ensured mypy/VS Code compliance.
- All critical errors and warnings resolved for this module.

---

[automation/cli_shortcuts.py]
----------------------------
- Added type hints and improved docstrings for all public functions.
- Fixed config access to use correct dictionary keys (removed .config usage).
- Improved error handling and user feedback for all CLI commands.
- Ensured all referenced functions are defined before use and fixed function ordering.
- Fixed indentation, removed unreachable/empty else blocks, and removed duplicate main entry point.
- All critical errors and warnings resolved for this module; ready for robust CLI automation.

---

[automation/notifier.py]
 All imports and dependencies are present and at the top of the file.
 Type hints added for all public classes, methods, and variables; mypy/VS Code compliant.
 Robust error handling for all notification channels (Discord, Email).
 All notification delivery errors are logged.
 Config toggles for enabling/disabling channels and demo/test vs. prod mode.
 HTML and rich formatting for email and Discord notifications.
 Notification test and daily summary methods included.
 All critical errors and warnings resolved; code is robust and production-ready.

[automation/pipeline_executor.py]

[automation/pipeline_executor.py]
-------------------------------
- All imports and dependencies are present and at the top of the file.
- Type hints added for all public classes, methods, and variables; mypy/VS Code compliant.
- Folder auto-creation for output/, input/, and logs/ in the constructor.
- Per-run log files with timestamp and summary footers; loguru support if available.
- Health check and batch trigger logic present and robust.
- Config toggle for demo/test vs. prod mode implemented.
- No async logic required for this module.
- Notification and monitoring hooks ready for integration.
- All indentation and logic errors fixed; code is robust and production-ready.
---
No further issues detected in pipeline_executor.py. Proceeding to next modules or final QA as needed.

[list_discovery/agent.py]
------------------------
- Added type hints to all public methods and variables for static analysis and clarity.
- Improved docstrings and error handling for all monitoring and agent logic.
- Ensured all imports are at the top and added missing import for Any.
- All critical errors and warnings resolved for this module; ready for robust list discovery automation.


[list_discovery/demo.py]
------------------------
- Added type hints throughout the file for all functions and class attributes.
- Improved and expanded docstrings for clarity and maintainability.
- Fixed config access to use runner.config directly, ensuring correct dictionary access.
- Removed unused and duplicate imports (json, time, sys, List, Optional, etc.).
- Moved all imports to the top of the file to comply with PEP 8.
- Fixed f-string usage and removed unused variables.
- Ensured all type hints (Dict, Any) are imported and used correctly.
- Cleaned up code for mypy and linter compliance; all lint/type errors resolved.
- File is now Python 3.11, mypy, and VS Code compliant.

No further issues detected in demo.py. Proceeding to next modules or final QA as needed.
